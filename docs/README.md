Ion-channel mechanism knowledge base
------------------------------------
We used INDRA to assemble all mechanisms that 65 ion channels that are
particularly important for nociception are involved in.

Each ion channel's interactions can be browsed as networks at
[`NDEx`](http://ndexbio.org/#/networkset/8f22b3bf-21d8-11ea-bb65-0ac135e8bacf).

And the literature evidence can be inspected [`here`](ion_channels.html)


A self-updating model of pain mechanisms
----------------------------------------

EMMAA (Ecosystem of Machine-maintained Models with Automated Analysis) makes
available a set of
computational models that are kept up-to-date using automated machine reading,
knowledge-assembly, and model generation, integrating new discoveries
immediately as they become available.

The EMMAA model representing pain mechanisms can be found
[`here`](https://emmaa.indra.bio/dashboard/painmachine).
